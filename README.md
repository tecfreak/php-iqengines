This is a bare bones example of using the query and update apis to send an image and retrieve results for that image. The scripts in this package will send in the included "sample.jpg" image.

### Usage

1. First change the API_KEY and API_SECRET variables in `query.php` and `update.php` to those provided in your developer dashboard [settings page][1].
2. run `php query.php`
3. run `php update.php`. If the call timeouts before you recieve a result you can re-run this script until you get a response.
